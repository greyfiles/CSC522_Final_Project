# CSC522_Final_Project

## Instructions For Setting Up Repository with ECONect Data set For Use With the Code:

1) Download the ECONet.zip data set from the course Moodle page
2) Extract the 'ECONet' directory and place it directly into the 'CSC522_Final_Project' directory
3) Create a new '.gitignore' file inside the 'ECONet' directory with just a '*' as the contents

## Instructions for setting up the code without the repository:

1) Extract .zip file
2) Run models.py to generate output - may have to change boolean variables within code to alter which tests are run. The models.py file uses relative paths to the data that is included in the zip file
